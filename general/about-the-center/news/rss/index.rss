			<title>Collegiate Running Summer Program</title>
			<link>https://www.craftsbury.com/general/about-the-center/news/detail/2285/</link>
			<description>We are excited to introduce our first collegiate runner to the summer athlete contingent: Quinn Cooney. New this year, the goal of our Collegiate Running Summer Program is to support dedicated collegiate runners as they train for the fall Cross Country season while also giving them valuable work experience here at the Center. In addition to training this summer, Quinn will act as the collegiate running coach for all of our summer running camps and help lead our weekly community running programs. Quinn has also elected to work with the Center&#039;s sustainability team on a number of summer projects. We are happy to have you on board, Quinn! More on Quinn: Quinn is a 2019 graduate of Dartmouth College in Hanover, NH and will be spending his first summer at the Craftsbury Outdoor Center before returning to Hanover for a degree in environmental and energy engineering. Quinn runs cross-country, indoor, and outdoor track at Dartmouth and has served as the captain of the cross-country team in 2018 and 2019. On the track he runs the 5k-10k but describes himself as a “grass specialist”. In 2018 after finishing 10th at the DI cross-country regional meet, he was named First Team All-Northeast Region. The same season he was named the team&#039;s outstanding performer. In 2019 he received the Paul S. Harmon Trophy for Improvement in Distance Running. Quinn loves running on soft surfaces with a belly full of freshly brewed coffee and maple oats, preferably when it’s under 85 degrees. Outside of running, Quinn is passionate about sustainable design, clean renewable energy, endurance sports, pour over coffee, The Avett Brothers, looking ridiculous, and Mario Kart Double Dash. </description>

			<title>Save the Date:  Skiing for Runners 2020</title>
			<link>https://www.craftsbury.com/general/about-the-center/news/detail/2113/</link>
			<description>January 2-5, 2020 - 4 DaysWe&#039;re excited to announce our winter cross-training weekend for runners. Treadmills have their place. Gym work has its time. But winter can get claustrophobic indoors. Add some skis, snowshoes or winter run gear? You&#039;ll move thru the winter landscape noiselessly, another animal exploring under its own power. During your four days at Craftsbury, you&#039;ll unlock tactics to embrace winter across a variety of disciplines: daily runs, ski clinics, snowshoeing on our more than 100k of groomed trails, plus another 20k of singletrack trails throughout our extensive trail network - all right out the door. Once you&#039;ve learned to winter, you&#039;ll reclaim your freedom to enjoy trails and woods that you haven&#039;t visited since last summer.More details to come, but get this weekend of fun, challenging cross-training and developing new skills on your calendar!</description>

			<title>Save the Date:  Skiing for Scullers, January 2-5, 2019</title>
			<link>https://www.craftsbury.com/general/about-the-center/news/detail/2146/</link>
			<description>Are you a sculler looking to expand your outdoor winter training options? Nordic skiing might just be the best way for rowers to cross-train while the liquid water is frozen – we certainly believe it is – and to that end, we’re hosting a “Skiing for Scullers” weekend January 2-5. It may surprise you to know that our GRP rowers spend more hours on skis from November through March than they do on the erg, and that they return to the water with even greater enthusiasm having given their bodies and their brains something new and different to work at. If anything, they find that not only have they not lost speed from the hiatus, they’ve gained greater readiness to put in more quality miles when they get back to liquid water. With equal measures of instruction, patience, and time, you can do the same, and this weekend will show you how.Craftsbury in winter is just as spectacular as Craftsbury in summer, with the focus shifted to gliding over snow instead of water. Following the same formula you know from sculling camps, we&#039;ll teach you how to ski (or how to improve your skiing) and how skiing will benefit your sculling next summer. Drills, video, training talks, a low student-to-coach ratio, our usual delicious food, and more will fill your weekend as you learn from our sculling staff who have become proficient skiers, as well as our full-time skiing staff. The program will have a focus on skate technique and is geared toward scullers who are beginning/intermediate skiers and would like to make Nordic skiing a viable cross-training option, gain a new athletic skill set, or simply find a new way to enjoy winter. Familiarity with some form of skiing or skating winter sports is a prerequisite, but vast Nordic-specific experience is not.The program includes three nights of lodging, full meals in our newly renovated dining hall, equipment rentals, trail passes, ski instruction, videotaping sessions and review, use of the Center’s facilities including fitness center, sauna, snowshoe trails, and more.  Questions about the program should be emailed to sculling director Troy Howell. More details to come, but keep this on your radar.</description>

			<title>Craftsbury Beer Run 2019 Results </title>
			<link>https://www.craftsbury.com/general/about-the-center/news/detail/2281/</link>
			<description>60 intrepid runners set out this morning under cloudy skies and cool temps to tackle the 2019 Craftsbury Beer Run. A point to point half marathon from the Outdoor Center to Hill Farmstead Brewery, the course covered trail, dirt road, and class IV roads, with some impressively grueling climbs and challenging terrain. What a way to spend the first morning of June here in the NEK!Frederick Rountree of Barre, VT ran to the overall win - and King of the Hill glory - in a time of 1:30:51. Fellow Vermonters Paul Chambers of Newport and Jake Lester of Craftsbury rounded out the top three in times of 1:38:14 and 1:40:32, respectively. Hallie Grossman of Craftsbury Common, VT captured the Queen of the Hill crown and fourth overall in a time of 1:44:03. Lori Preston of Richmond, VT ran to second place female in 1:56:19 and Courtney Koshchei crossed the line as third female in 1:57:31. Congrats to all the runners for conquering the climbs and trails of this year&#039;s challenging course! Full results can be found here. With the help of our local partners and community support, we were able to raise over $2,000 for the WonderArts VT &#039;Farm to Kids&#039; Table&#039; program. WonderArts VT has served both youth and adult populations in the Greater Hardwick Area (Craftsbury, Greensboro, Hardwick) for the last two years. Their goal is to support lifelong learning for all age groups by emphasizing creativity, recreation, technology, and sustainability. The Farm to Kids&#039; Table program works with age groups 6-12 and 13-16 and teaches basic cooking skills under the direction of a WonderArts staff chef. We are excited to be able to support this kid-centered and kid-driven initiative working to empower young people through learning about local food and food creation.Many, many thanks to Hill Farmstead Brewery for the beer and ideal race destination, Craftsbury General Store for the tasty picnic, KIS Kombucha for sharing more local brews, UnTapped for the maple feeds, Gebbies&#039; Maplehurst Farm for the liquid gold prizes, and John Lazenby for capturing the scene! Thank you also to the volunteers and community for your generous support - this event could not have happened without you!And, of course, thank you to all the participants for embarking on the 2019 Craftsbury Beer Run! We are excited to have partnered with so many local businesses in a team effort to raise money for WonderArts VT&#039;s &#039;Farm to Kid&#039;s Table&#039; program. A day filled with running and local food &amp;amp; drink really did feel like the perfect way to give back to such a great program. We hope to have you back for another adventure run through the Northeast Kingdom soon!For more photos (coming soon!) and information about our fundraiser run for WonderArts VT, please visit our Facebook page and website event page. </description>

			<title>GRP Races at Canal de Lachine in Montreal</title>
			<link>https://www.craftsbury.com/general/about-the-center/news/detail/2279/</link>
			<description>The GRP traveled to Canada last weekend for some good ole fashioned Quebecer racing. The 11th annual Lachine Regatta was held on the Canal de Lachine in Montreal. As this regatta was free of “US national ranking implications” the GRP decided to made the most of the trip by doubling up in two events each - everyone raced in both the 1x and the 4x.The first race of the day was the 1x event. There were nearly 50 entries between the open men/women, masters men/women, and junior boys/girls. The racecourse was a 5k stretch in a shipping canal. Much to Wes’ demise, the start line was about 1k downstream from a set of shipping locks, which he desperately wanted to row through. But, even without the locks, the course certainly had its share of crazy obstacles. Over the course of 5k, the competitors had to navigate themselves through six bridges and around countless port/starboard buoys - some of which were located in the middle of the canal. The format was head race style with approximately ten second intervals between each competitor. This made for some pretty interesting racing as there was a lot of passing and lead changes taking place in a narrow canal. It was a successful morning outing for everyone in the 1x as it was a total Cedar Leaf sweep in all events. The men took places 1-5 in the event with Lucas coming in first, followed by Kevin, Wes, Nate and Andy in that order. Alex and Bridget took first and second respectively in the women’s division, and Troy took home the W in the men’s masters 1x. The group came in for a quick snack and reboot before they headed out in quads. Both 4xs raced in the open men’s division, but had slightly diverse lineups in that the women, Alex and Bridget raced in each of the quads, and Troy joined one as well.The second race of the day turned into a GRP vs. GRP battle as the two boats were able to separate themselves from the rest of the field within the first two kilometers of the race. Eventually, the 4x with Lucas, Andy, Kevin and Bridget came out with the win over Troy, Nathan, Wes and Alex. It was a great event in Montreal and the GRP is grateful for the great hospitality of the folks at Lachine Rowing Club. They are now back on Hosmer and look forward to training for Club Nationals and Trials III.</description>

			<title>GRP Race at Trials II/Speed Order II</title>
			<link>https://www.craftsbury.com/general/about-the-center/news/detail/2277/</link>
			<description>Last weekend the rowers of the Green Racing Project traveled to Princeton, NJ to compete in their second race of the 2019 season. The regatta had different implications for the men and the women, as it was Trials for the Women’s 2x – meaning that the winner of the regatta earned the right to represent the United States in the 2x at this summer’s World Championships in Linz, Austria. Whereas it was a Speed Order for the Men’s 2x – meaning that the winner of the regatta earned the right to race at World Cup II, but will have to race at Trials III in July to earn the right to race at the World Championships in August. After a successful Trials I in the 1x, the members of the GRP had to do a bit of “dating around” to find a partner in the lead up to 2x Trials. Some members of the team found their match within the GRP, ie. Wes and Nathan on the men’s side and Alex and Taylor on the women’s side. Meanwhile, other GRPers linked up with rowers from different club programs. Lucas raced with Jacob Plihal from Vesper, Kevin raced with JP Kirkegaard from Vesper, Andy raced with Eric Hallenbeck from MRC, John raced with Justin Keen from PennAC, and Bridget found her match in Charlotte Buck from NYAC.Racing kicked off on Thursday AM with a 1900m Time Trial. Due to limited entries, no crews were eliminated in the Time Trial, but were seeded into heats based on finish order. The heats were scheduled to take place Friday morning, but in true Princeton-in-the-Spring fashion, Friday afternoon winds forced the race officials to push racing forward by half a day. Therefore the heats took place Thursday evening. On the men’s side, the top four from each heat advanced to the A/B semis, and the fifth place crews went directly to the C-final. Wes/Nathan, Lucas/Jacob, Kevin/JP and John/Justin all advanced to the A/B Semis and Andy/Eric went on to race in and win the C-final. On the women’s side, only the top two from each heat advanced directly to the semi’s and all others went to Friday morning repechages. Alex/Taylor and Bridget/Charlotte narrowly missed out on the top two spots, therefore the two GRP boats had to face each other in Friday morning’s repechage. Alex/Taylor came out on top with Bridget/Charlotte taking second place. Unfortunately only Alex/Taylor were able to move on to the semi’s. Saturday morning&#039;s semis had mixed results for the GRP. Due to the Trials four-lane progression on the women’s side, only the top two from each semi advanced to the final on Sunday. Alex/Taylor took a hard-fought third place in their semi and therefore did not move onto the final. On the men’s side, the top three from each semi moved onto the A final and the rest went to the B final. John/Justin, Kevin/JP and Lucas/Jacob all advanced to the A-final. Wes/Nathan narrowly missed the cutoff, but went on to win Sunday’s B final. Sunday’s Men’s 2x A final was hot and GRP heavy as half of the boats in the final were powered by Cedar Leaves. John/Justin came away with the win with Kevin/JP coming in second and Lucas/Jacob taking fifth place!Overall it was a great weekend of racing for the GRP. The team is happy to be back training on Hosmer as they look ahead to Trials III and Club Nationals in July!</description>

			<title>GRP Race at Trials I</title>
			<link>https://www.craftsbury.com/general/about-the-center/news/detail/2269/</link>
			<description>This past week the Men and Women of the Craftsbury Green Racing Project Rowing Team started their racing season down in Sarasota Florida at the USRowing Trials I Regatta which selected the Men&#039;s and Women&#039;s Single Sculls that will represent the US at this year&#039;s World Rowing Championships in Linz, Austria in September. This year is an especially important World Championships as it is qualification year for the 2020 Olympic Games that will be held in Tokyo next summer. Countries wishing to compete at the Olympics must qualify each boat by finishing within a certain number of spots of first place, depending on boat class. For example, the top five finishers in the 8+ at Worlds will qualify their country for that boat for the following year&#039;s Olympics. But for the Double Sculls, it&#039;s the top eleven finishers, with all the other boat classes falling somewhere in between those numbers. Needless to say, it&#039;s always a very high stakes World Championships during the year prior to the Olympics. The GRP were wrapping up their annual spring training trip after spending four weeks in Deland Florida before they headed down to Sarasota to race. This year saw the deepest fields that have raced at Singles Trials in the past three years, with 43 entries in the Men&#039;s Single and 24 entries in the Women&#039;s Single. This regatta also hosted a Speed Order for them Men&#039;s and Women&#039;s lightweight singles which doesn&#039;t select those respective athletes for World Championships but provides them an opportunity to race the rest of the field in the US and see how everyone stacks up against each other. The Men&#039;s and Women&#039;s Lightweight singles had similarly large numbers of entries. Racing started Thursday the 18th with Time Trials for all boats. The open weight singles fields were cut down to the top 14 finishers in the time trial with a four-boat progression following and the lightweight singles were cut down to 16 athletes. A sunny morning with a strong crosstail wind greeted the athletes with challenging conditions to start the weekend of racing. On the Women&#039;s side of the GRP, Mickey Fili finished 4th in the time trial followed by Alex Spaulding in 11th, Taylor Goetzinger in 12th, and Bridget Schodorf in 20th. On the Men&#039;s side John Graves placed first in the Time Trial with Kevin Meador taking 6th, Lucas Bellows placing 15th, Wes Vear 17th, Nathan Lado 24th, and Andy Raitto 28th. Only those in the top 14th advanced to the Heats that evening. Jenny Mcilvane finished 15th in the lightweight single, advancing to her heat. It was a bittersweet race for those eliminated because, while they all raced well, the depth of the fields meant that making it through the time trial was no trivial feat. In the heats, Fili won her heat and Goetzinger placed 4th, relegating to the repechages Saturday morning. Spaulding placed third in her heat, also heading to the reps. Meador won his heat, advancing straight to the semifinals Saturday afternoon with Graves placing second in his heat and moving to the reps. Mcilvane placed 5th in her heat, sending her to the C level final Saturday morning.Friday&#039;s racing was moved around to accommodate extreme winds so the athletes had an off day before Saturday morning reps took place. The athletes took advantage of the day off to recover and mentally prepare for the following day of tough racing.

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[This past week the Men and Women of the Craftsbury Green Racing Project Rowing Team started their racing season down in Sarasota Florida at the USRowing Trials I Regatta which selected the Men&#039;s and Women&#039;s Single Sculls that will represent the US at this year&#039;s World Rowing Championships in Linz, Austria in September. This year is an especially important World Championships as it is qualification year for the 2020 Olympic Games that will be held in Tokyo next summer. Countries wishing to compete at the Olympics must qualify each boat by finishing within a certain number of spots of first place, depending on boat class. For example, the top five finishers in the 8+ at Worlds will qualify their country for that boat for the following year&#039;s Olympics. But for the Double Sculls, it&#039;s the top eleven finishers, with all the other boat classes falling somewhere in between those numbers. Needless to say, it&#039;s always a very high stakes World Championships during the year prior to the Olympics. The GRP were wrapping up their annual spring training trip after spending four weeks in Deland Florida before they headed down to Sarasota to race. This year saw the deepest fields that have raced at Singles Trials in the past three years, with 43 entries in the Men&#039;s Single and 24 entries in the Women&#039;s Single. This regatta also hosted a Speed Order for them Men&#039;s and Women&#039;s lightweight singles which doesn&#039;t select those respective athletes for World Championships but provides them an opportunity to race the rest of the field in the US and see how everyone stacks up against each other. The Men&#039;s and Women&#039;s Lightweight singles had similarly large numbers of entries. Racing started Thursday the 18th with Time Trials for all boats. The open weight singles fields were cut down to the top 14 finishers in the time trial with a four-boat progression following and the lightweight singles were cut down to 16 athletes. A sunny morning with a strong crosstail wind greeted the athletes with challenging conditions to start the weekend of racing. On the Women&#039;s side of the GRP, Mickey Fili finished 4th in the time trial followed by Alex Spaulding in 11th, Taylor Goetzinger in 12th, and Bridget Schodorf in 20th. On the Men&#039;s side John Graves placed first in the Time Trial with Kevin Meador taking 6th, Lucas Bellows placing 15th, Wes Vear 17th, Nathan Lado 24th, and Andy Raitto 28th. Only those in the top 14th advanced to the Heats that evening. Jenny Mcilvane finished 15th in the lightweight single, advancing to her heat. It was a bittersweet race for those eliminated because, while they all raced well, the depth of the fields meant that making it through the time trial was no trivial feat. In the heats, Fili won her heat and Goetzinger placed 4th, relegating to the repechages Saturday morning. Spaulding placed third in her heat, also heading to the reps. Meador won his heat, advancing straight to the semifinals Saturday afternoon with Graves placing second in his heat and moving to the reps. Mcilvane placed 5th in her heat, sending her to the C level final Saturday morning.Friday&#039;s racing was moved around to accommodate extreme winds so the athletes had an off day before Saturday morning reps took place. The athletes took advantage of the day off to recover and mentally prepare for the following day of tough racing.

			<title>Green Racing Project at SuperTour Finals</title>
			<link>https://www.craftsbury.com/general/about-the-center/news/detail/2265/</link>
			<description>The Green Racing Project skiers finished up their 2018-2019 season in Presque Isle, Maine, with a four race series at SuperTour Finals. Always the last races of the season, SuperTour Finals are one of the few times when American World Cup skiers return to the US to compete with the domestic field. This year, the races also were the final hurrah for GRP skier Ida Sargent, who announced her retirement from the sport a few weeks ago.March 29- Freestyle SprintRaces kicked off with a freestyle sprint. All six GRP athletes qualified: Ida Sargent led the women in 3rd, Caitlin Patterson took 9th, Kaitlynn Miller was 13th, and Liz Guiney took 18th. On the men&#039;s side, Ben Lustgarten qualified in 16th and Akeo Maifeld-Carucci took 22nd. Sargent skied well all the way through the heats, eventually taking 2nd in the A Final. Patterson also skied well, winning her quarterfinal heat and placing 5th in her semifinal for 10th overall. Guiney and Miller were eliminated in the quarterfinals, and placed 14th and 16th, respectively. Lustgarten and Maifeld-Carucci were also bumped out in quarterfinals and placed 14th and 23rd, respectively.March 30- 10/15k Classic Mass StartThe following day brought fast icy tracks for a classic mass start. After several hours of delay to soften the course, the men were underway with their 15k. Lustgarten skied well, placing 8th, and Maifeld-Carucci took 19th place. In the women&#039;s 10k mass start, Sargent built on her momentum from the previous day and took 5th place, followed by Patterson in 6th. Miller took 9th, and Guiney was 20th.March 31- Mixed Club 4x5k RelayOn the third consecutive day of racing, athletes had to put it all on the line for their teams in the mixed club relay. The format was as follows: 4x5k starting with a female classic leg, then a male classic leg, a female freestyle leg, then finishing with a male freestyle leg. The GRP I &quot;Cedar Leaves&quot; team of Ida Sargent, Ben Lustgarten, Caitlin Patterson, and Akeo Maifeld-Carucci took 4th place in the official category, close to the podium. Liz Guiney and Kaitlynn Miller teamed up with Alaska Winter Stars skier Gus Schumacher and Salomon rep/former GRP skier Bryan Cook. Their team took 2nd in the unofficial category and 7th overall.April 2- 30/50k Freestyle Mass StartAfter a rest day, athletes took on the final race of the season and arguably one of the most grueling: 30 and 50k freestyle mass starts. The women went first, skiing in fast conditions for their 30k. Patterson led the way for the GRP, finishing 7th. Miller took 9th, Sargent was 12th, Guiney was 17th, and biathlete Kelsey Dickinson took 28th. The men raced 50k a few hours later in ever softening snow. Biathlete Jake Brown stayed with the lead pack for the majority of the race and finished 5th. Lustgarten skied a blazing last two laps to finish 6th, followed by Maifeld-Carucci in 11th and Adam Martin was 14th. Results from SuperTour Finals are available on BullittTiming. With the season over, the skiers and biathletes will take a rest before resuming the training season in May!</description>

			<title>Sargent Retires from World Cup Racing in Quebec City</title>
			<link>https://www.craftsbury.com/general/about-the-center/news/detail/2261/</link>
			<description>It was an emotional and bittersweet weekend in Quebec City as Green Racing Project and US Ski and Snowboard athlete Ida Sargent skied the final World Cup races of her career. She has been racing full-time for the past 9 years, and represented the US in two Olympics (in 2014 and 2018). At the tail end of a long and successful career, she is hanging up the boards this year, but not without leaving a lasting impression on the Craftsbury community and the next generation of nordic athletes. Because the World Cup season ended close to home in North America, Sargent was able to ski her last races in front of her family, longtime GRP coach Pepa Miloucheva, teammates, friends, and supporters. In addition, her GRP teammates Kaitlynn Miller and Caitlin Patterson raced with the US team in Quebec City.Freestyle SprintRacing action kicked off on Friday, March 22 with a freestyle sprint. With a lack of an overnight freeze and new precipitation, the course quickly turned to soft, ankle deep slush, which was an added challenge for the athletes. Unfortunately, both Sargent and Miller were racing with colds, but they put in their best effort regardless. Sargent finished 49th in the qualifier, Caitlin Patterson took 58th, and Miller was 61st.Classic Mass StartThe following day, the course firmed up well, making for fast classic tracks and treacherous downhills. In the women&#039;s 10k mass start, Sargent led the way for the Green Team women placing 48th, followed closely by Miller in 49th, and Patterson in 53rd.Freestyle PursuitThe final day of competition brought a freestyle pursuit, with start order determined by the combined time of the previous two day&#039;s races, in addition to any bonus seconds picked up along the way. Sargent, Miller, and Patterson all started in a wave +3:10 behind the first skier. Patterson skied up from her starting position of 52, finishing 46th in the overall mini-tour with the 43rd fastest time of the day. Sargent finished in 48th place, and Miller was 52nd. Upon crossing the line, Sargent&#039;s teammates immediately showered her in champagne and gathered her in a group hug.Full results from the weekend are available on FIS-Ski.com. The Green Team will finish their season March 29-April 2 in Presque Isle, ME for SuperTour Finals. </description>

			<description>This past weekend the IBU World Cup season wrapped up at the Holmenkollen stadium in Oslo, Norway. Three GRP biathletes toed the line and came away with strong results highlighted by Clare Egan’s first ever podium finish in the mass start.The weekend got underway with a sprint event in which Clare finished 12th with just one standing miss. Susan Dunklee placed 30th with two misses, one in each stage. For the men, Jake Brown placed a solid 47th with three misses.  All three GRP biathletes qualified for the pursuit. Clare moved up to 9th place with three misses. She cleaned both middles stages. Susan moved up considerably placing 18th also with three misses. She cleaned her first two stages. In the men&#039;s race, Jake finished 48th with four misses.                     Clare was the only GRP athlete in the mass start, but she represented the team well racing to her first ever World Cup podium in 3rd. She had the best shooting in the race with only one miss. In a winter full of strong performances and personal bests for Clare, it seems only fitting that she would race her way onto the podium in the season’s final World Cup. While the IBU and World Cup seasons have come to a close, there’s one more biathlon event still to come: Nationals in Jericho, Vermont. Racing starts Friday (3/29) and the whole GRP biathlon will be competing so stay tuned for one more dose of biathlon fun before the off-season is upon us!Full World Cup results can be found at biathlonworld.com. </description>

			<title>GRP Skiers at Falun World Cup</title>
			<link>https://www.craftsbury.com/general/about-the-center/news/detail/2256/</link>
			<description>Over the weekend, Green Racing Project skiers competed in the final European World Cup races of the season in Falun, Sweden. With the Drammen sprints just four days prior, the turnaround to Falun was a tight one. Kaitlynn Miller, as the SuperTour leader, competed in both the freestyle sprint and 10k freestyle, while Ida Sargent raced the sprint.In Saturday&#039;s sprint, skiers faced one of the shorter World Cup sprint courses, but also one with very technical downhills. In spring conditions, some of the downhill corners accumulated deep slush and ruts that took out many skiers. In the qualifier, Sargent finished 37th, just over one second from the top 30. Miller fell prey to a slushy corner in her qualifier and ended up 61st.The following day was a 10k freestyle individual start. Miller had her best World Cup result of the season, finishing 34th in the 10k. She was +2:21 from winner Therese Johaug (who beat 2nd place by almost 20 seconds).With the European World Cup circuit completed, there is only one weekend of racing remaining in the WC season. On February 22-24, Quebec City will host a three race weekend, including a freestyle sprint, classic mass start, and freestyle pursuit. Sargent and Miller will be joined by Caitlin Patterson on the US World Cup team for Quebec.Results from Falun are available, as always, on FIS-ski.com. </description>

			<title>Vermont Victory at EHSC</title>
			<link>https://www.craftsbury.com/general/about-the-center/news/detail/2255/</link>
			<description>Last Friday through Sunday, several hundred of the best high school skiers from New England descended on the wilds of Northern Maine for Eastern High School Championships. This three-day racing extravaganza was held at the Fort Kent Outdoor Center and had four race: 5k skate, 7.5k mass start, Nordic Cross sprint, and a mixed relay. Seven CNSC juniors represented Team Vermont at this championship event, helping Vermont bring home the overall team trophy.After exiting the bus from the long drive to Fort Kent, racers readied themselves for 5k individual start races. If you recall, Friday was a very warm, spring-like day, adding extra challenge to the event with soft snow, but this did not deter the Craftsbury crew from turning in podium worthy race results!
Girls:
4. May Lamb
8. Maggie McGee


Boys:
3. Jack Young
12. Greyson Davis
22. Aiden Casey
23. Tzevi Schwartz
26. Makail Tipton

On Saturday, racers were greeted with cooler temperatures, though there were still many t-shirts to be seen, for the 7.5k classic mass start races. The racers did Friday’s 5k loop, plus an additional 2.5k spur at the end.
Girls:
13. May
19. Maggie


Boys:
7. Greyson
11. jack
27. Aiden
38. Tzevi
50. Makail

In the afternoon, racers tested their agility and speed in the 1.1k Nordic Cross sprint event. This is a new addition to the Eastern High Schools calendar and it seems that competitors enjoy it. This race favors those that have honed their quickness and fearlessness, all essential qualities of a good Nordic racer! NENSA describes this event as having a “drop jump, banked turn, slalom gates, rollers, and the famous bicycle pump. Skiers went off in waves of 4 and competed head to head to make their way through the course with the fastest time while navigating the agility features.” 
Girls:
17. Maggie
52. May
 


Boys:
9. Greyson
10. Jack
25. Makail
44. Aiden
59. Tzevi

The series concluded with four-person mixed relay: two girls, two boys, two skaters, two classic skiers. Each skier went 3.3k.1. Greyson (Emma Strack, Jed Kurts, Sage Freeman)6. May (Jack Drew, Jack Christner, Liza Bell)11. Tzevi (Brook Hodgeman, Lily Porth, Sarah Gallager)16. Makail and Maggie (Natalie Jelley, Thomas Despres)18. Aiden (Tim Cobb, Addy Harris, Geneva Cote)19. Jack (Jax Lubkowitz, Sadie Holmes, Shams Ferver)At the end of races, the Graham Taylor cup is awarded to the team that scored the most points during the weekend, and Team Vermont won this award! Weekend long individual successes are also recognized. In the individual boys’ rankings, Jack was 3rd, followed closely by Greyson in 4th. See results here.Though the racing season is nearly over, these skiers (and anyone else who chooses!) can continue testing their Nordic Cross skills at Cochran’s ski area on April 8.</description>

			<title>Speedy Juniors at Anchorage Junior Nationals</title>
			<link>https://www.craftsbury.com/general/about-the-center/news/detail/2254/</link>
			<description>Last week, a crew of six Craftsbury juniors travelled to Anchorage, Alaska to compete at the week-long Cross Country Junior Nationals event, representing Team New England. This series brings together more than 400 of the best skiers aged 15-19 in the country for four fiercely competitive races. Coaches Anna Schulz and Ollie Burruss were part of the Team New England waxing staff. Two recent CNSC alums competed as well; Jordi Kulis, now attending St. Lawrence University and representing the Mid-Atlantic region Callie Young, now attending Dartmouth College and racing for New England.The series kicked off with individual start freestyle races. In the U18/U20 boys’ race, Griffin Wright led the way for CNSC in 10th (5th U18), followed by Finn Sweet in 24th (14th U18), then Caleb Streinz in 52nd (24th U20). In the 5k U18/U20 girls’ race, Callie was 7th (3rd U20), Adrienne Remick was 53rd (38th U18), and Jordi was 91st (28th U20). In the U16 girls’ 5k, Quincy Massey-Bierman was 12th, followed by Camille Bolduc in 13th. With one day off, racers readied themselves for a full day of classic sprinting, which is often Team New England’s specialty. In the U20 boys’ division, Caleb qualified in 19th, where he then finished 5th in his quarterfinal, ending his day in 22nd place. In the U18 boys’, Griffin ended the day in 10th, after qualifying in 11th, placing 2nd in his quarterfinal, 4th in his semi-final, and then 4th in the B final. Finn ultimately placed 13th on the day, qualifying 20th then getting eliminated in the quarterfinals after placing 3rd. On the girls’ side, Jordi was 32nd in the qualifier, while Callie qualified 7th, then finished 2nd in her quarterfinal, 2nd in her semi-final, then 4th in the A final (and it was her birthday!). In the U18 girls’ race, Adrienne was 35th in the qualifier. In the U16 girls’ race, Quincy ended the day in the silver medal position, after qualifying 7th, placing 1st in her quarterfinal, 2nd in her semi-final, then 2nd in the A final. Camille also had a great day, placing 6th in the qualifier, 2nd in her quarterfinal, 4th in the semifinal, then 3rd in the B-final, landing her in 9th. After one more day off, there was a flurry of classic mass starts of varying distances for different ages groups. The U20 boys raced 15k, where Caleb was 42nd. The U18 boys raced 10k, where Griffin won the bronze medal and Finn was 6th. In the U20 girls’ 10k, Callie was 9th and Jordi was 24th, while Adrienne was 23rd in the U18 girls’ 10k. The U16’s raced 5k, where Camille and Quincy were separated by one second for 12th and 13th, respectively. The final day of racing brought about three-person freestyle relays. Teams are made up of athletes from the same geographic region. In the U20 boys’ race, Caleb teamed up with Alex Burt and Matthew Moreau for 16th. In the U20 girls’ race, Callie was on the bronze medal team, along with Sophia Laukli and Kirsten Miller. Jordi teamed up with Mid-Atlantic teammates Jordan Schuster and Sylvan Linck for 13th. In the U18 boys’ race, Josh Valentine, Griffin, and Will Koch were 4th place, while Brian Bushey, Keelan Durham, and Finn were 7th. In the U18 girls’ relay, Adrienne was on the 11th place team with Laura Appleby and Madeline Kitch. In the U16 girls’ race, Quincy’s team of herself, Sofia Scirica and Ava Thurston won silver, while Camille teamed up with Elsa Bolinger and Evelyn Walton for 7th. Although Junior Nationals is comprised primarily of individual competitions, it is also very much a team event, where regional teams are vying for the Alaska Cup. The Alaska Cup is awarded to the team with the most points over the week. New England won for the 6th time in a row this year! Also, the Craftsbury Nordic Ski Club was 10th out of 49 teams in the Club Teams ranking. Congratulations to all the mini-greenies who demonstrated all the great training that takes place in the Northeast Kingdom!See results here.  </description>

The U20 boys raced 15k, where Caleb was 42nd. The U18 boys raced 10k, where Griffin won the bronze medal and Finn was 6th. In the U20 girls’ 10k, Callie was 9th and Jordi was 24th, while Adrienne was 23rd in the U18 girls’ 10k. The U16’s raced 5k, where Camille and Quincy were separated by one second for 12th and 13th, respectively. The final day of racing brought about three-person freestyle relays. Teams are made up of athletes from the same geographic region. In the U20 boys’ race, Caleb teamed up with Alex Burt and Matthew Moreau for 16th. In the U20 girls’ race, Callie was on the bronze medal team, along with Sophia Laukli and Kirsten Miller. Jordi teamed up with Mid-Atlantic teammates Jordan Schuster and Sylvan Linck for 13th. In the U18 boys’ race, Josh Valentine, Griffin, and Will Koch were 4th place, while Brian Bushey, Keelan Durham, and Finn were 7th. In the U18 girls’ relay, Adrienne was on the 11th place team with Laura Appleby and Madeline Kitch. In the U16 girls’ race, Quincy’s team of herself, Sofia Scirica and Ava Thurston won silver, while Camille teamed up with Elsa Bolinger and Evelyn Walton for 7th. Although Junior Nationals is comprised primarily of individual competitions, it is also very much a team event, where regional teams are vying for the Alaska Cup. The Alaska Cup is awarded to the team with the most points over the week. New England won for the 6th time in a row this year! Also, the Craftsbury Nordic Ski Club was 10th out of 49 teams in the Club Teams ranking.

			<title>GRP&#039;s Akeo Maifeld-Carucci Wins American Birkebeiner; Martin and Patterson at World Championships</title>
			<link>https://www.craftsbury.com/general/about-the-center/news/detail/2238/</link>
			<description>It was a big weekend for the Green Racing Project skiers, as Akeo Maifeld-Carucci won his first American Birkebeiner (know colloquially as the Birkie). It also marked the first time that a Green Racing Project athlete has won the Birkie, a 52k freestyle marathon through the woods of Northern Wisconsin. The race has the largest field in North America, and certainly the most prestigious marathon on the continent every year. Meanwhile, on the other side of the world Caitlin Patterson and Adam Martin made their World Championship debuts in Seefeld, Austria.American BirkieThis year, skiers faced slow conditions and new snow on the 52k trek from Cable to Hayward, Wisconsin. Maifeld-Carucci was skiing in the main pack of approximately 10 skiers until the &quot;halfway&quot; point at OO, with 28k remaining. At that point, Brian Gregg made a breakaway, and Maifeld-Carucci and Matt Liebsch chased him down. From that point, it was a pack of three skiers until the finish line. With the finishing line in sight, Maifeld-Carucci made his sprint for the line and took the win by 0.9 seconds over Gregg in second and Liebsch in third. As the overall winner and first American finisher, Maifeld-Carucci wins $10,000 as well as a mattress from Slumberland Furniture, one of the main event sponsors. Full results from the Birkie are here. Also look for GRP alums Bryan Cook, Hannah Dreissigacker, and Nils Koons, as well as rowing camp director Troy Howell.World ChampionshipsIn Seefeld, Austria, the nordic World Championships kicked off on February 21st with a freestyle sprint. GRP skiers competed in their first race on Saturday, in the 15k and 30k mass start skiathlon. In a skiathlon, skiers start with classic, then halfway through the race switch over to skate skis. Caitlin Patterson, on the heels of a cold, took 34th in the women&#039;s 15k skiathlon. Patterson was a 2018 Olympian in Pyeongchang, but this race marked her World Championships debut. On the men&#039;s side, Adam Martin, competing in his first World Championships race, finished 54th in the 30k skiathlon. Full results from Seefeld are available here. Ben Lustgarten is expected to race for the US in the 15k classic individual start on February 27th. The viewing schedule for the remaining events at World Championships is below: February 27: 15km classic, men, 8:00amFebruary 28: 4x5km relay, women, 7:00amMarch 1: 4x10km relay, men, 7:15amMarch 2: 30km skate mass start, women, 6:15amMarch 3: 50km skate mass start, men, 7:00am</description>

			<link>https://www.craftsbury.com/general/about-the-center/news/detail/2236/</link>
			<description>What a spectacular February day! We couldn&#039;t have asked for better weather to spend an afternoon snowshoe running, fat tire biking, and cross country skiing all over our ski and singletrack trail networks. Congrats to all of our winter triathlon participants for conquering a challenging 17k of trail and to our snowshoe racers for running fast in soft snow. And here&#039;s to the man himself, Keith Woodward, for not only designing, packing, and marking all of the courses but for also competing in the event! Full results of the winter triathlon and snowshoe race are posted here. Keith Woodward took the win in the men&#039;s triathlon in a time of 1:27:58 while Maureen McAuliffe took the win in the women&#039;s triathlon in a time of 1:34:47. Married duo Darrel and Cheryl Lasell won their respective 4k snowshoe events. We enjoyed welcoming racers from near and far, and look forward to hosting the event again next year. Thanks to all for the help and the cheering! </description>

			<description>CNSC juniors strapped on their skis for the third weekend of Eastern Cup racing on Saturday and Sunday, this time at the Rikert Nordic Center in Ripton, VT. Saturday’s skate races were combined with the Middlebury Carnival while Sunday’s classic races were a standalone Eastern Cup.Saturday’s combined Carnival and Forest Mountain Eastern Cup meant a large, deep field and stiff competition for our junior racers. The women all raced 5k, so even the U16’s got to test their mettle against the college racers! Abbee Streinz was the first CNSC finisher of the day, in 24th (2nd U18). Quincy Massey-Bierman was next in 71st (5th U16), then Camille Bolduc in 74th (6th U16), followed by Adrienne Remick in 85th (14th U16). May Lamb was 118th (16th U16), followed by Maggie McGee in 110th (19th U16) and Sydney Kulis in 169th (46th U18). On the men’s side, Griffin Wright led the way in 31st (2nd U18), then Finn Sweet in 52nd (6th U18), and Caleb Streinz in 73rd (24th U20). Jack Young was 114th (26th U18), then Makail Tipton in 132nd (37th U18), and Greyson Davis in 134th (38th U18). The U16 boys raced 5k, where Cormac Leahy was 9th, Aiden Casey was 11th, Lucas Streinz was 12th, and Orion Cenkl was 23rd. Tzevi Schwartz was 25th, Owen Jones was 30th, and Linden Stelma-Leonard was 40th. On Sunday, most of the college skiers headed back to their schools and the fields were a bit smaller, but the mass start racing was fast and furious nonetheless. In the U16 girl’s 5k race, Quincy was 2nd, Camille was 5th, May was 16th, and Maggie was 19th. The U16 boy’s 5k was a sea of green! Aiden was 9th, Orion was 10th, and Cormac was 12th. Tzevi was 24th, Lucas was 26th, and Linden was 38th. In the women’s 10k, Adrienne was 16th (11th U18) and Abbee was 24th (16th U18). In the men’s 15k, Griffin kept up his stellar weekend, placing 2nd (2nd U18), followed by Finn in 20th (10th U18) and Caleb in 41st (13th U20). Jack was 43rd (21st U28), then Makail in 50th (28th U18), and Greyson was 51st (29th U18). Rikert also hosted a Citizen’s Race 5k and 10k. Owen Jones won the 5k!Back in Craftsbury, Adrian Owens organized a Ski-O race on Sunday with three distances: short, medium, and long. In the middle-distance race, which was 6.1k, Ruth Krebs and Amelia Circosta teamed up for 4th.

These will be the final Junior National qualifying races.
