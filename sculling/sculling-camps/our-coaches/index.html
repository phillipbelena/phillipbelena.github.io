In addition to managing our sculling camps, Troy also spends part of his year as one of the coaches of our resident athletes in the SBTC and GRP programs and works to ensure that our sculling programs complement one another and are consistent with the Outdoor Center's mission and philosophy. Despite being an introvert and intermittent misanthrope, he is also really funny, if you can manage to wrestle a smile out of him.</p><br><br><em></em> </div>

Bower capped her successful international rowing career at the 1984 Summer Olympics, where she won gold in the Women's 8+.

She then went on to become the Head Coach of the University of Pennsylvania's Women's Rowing program from 1987 to 1996. She also coached the Women’s 4+ at the 1988 Summer Olympics. In addition to her coaching experience, she worked with a group of fellow Olympians in a team-building and leadership-training company Team Concepts, Inc. Presently, Carol is the Head Rowing Coach and a Senior Lecturer at Bryn Mawr College. Bower was named to the Rowing Hall of Fame in 1984 and again in 1991.</p><br><br><em></em> </div>

Subsequent years brought Steve to many different clubs and coaches as he attempted to climb the sculling ranks: Penn AC, GMS, Potomac, NYAC, the Olympic Training Center in Chula Vista, and the National Team Training Center in Princeton. He selected for two World Cup teams in the double in 2009 and 2010.  In 2012, he raced to a second place finish in the double at the 2012 Olympic Trials.
