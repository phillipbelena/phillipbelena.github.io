John received the 2010 McCook Trophy, which recognizes the top senior male athlete at Trinity College.</p>
<p><strong>Summer 2010:</strong> John's summer at Craftsbury didn't start off well: he arrived with double partner Will Kelly, who immediately injured his back and had to go home, giving up rowing for the summer. No matter: John decided to row in a single and, more impressively, turn lightweight just a few weeks before U23 trials. The gamble paid off and he posted a big win at trials, earning a spot on the squad for U23 World Championships in Belarus. At U23's, John rowed some strong heats, ultimately finishing 5th in the B Final of the lightweight single. His 11th-place overall finish was the best ever recorded for a U.S. lightweight sculler. John finished his summer season with the SBTC by rowing in a pair with his brother, Peter, and in an eight at Canadian Henley.</p>
<p><strong>2009:</strong> Since his arrival at Trinity College in the fall of 2006, rowing has been half of John's athletic experience: he was on the varsity soccer team, starting every game in four seasons, becoming captain, and achieving All-League Honors in 2009. However, rowing is his true passion. In 2008, he rowed bow of the ECAC Champion Trinity 8+ that went on to win four races at Henley before falling short in the Finals. In 2009, John trained with the SBTC before competing at U23 World Championships in the pair with Eli Roxby. John said, "Eli and I were products of the daily routine at the Center which injects purpose, friendship, and of course, really good food into the athletes and employees. Craftsbury understands the needs of an elite athlete and does a fantastic job outfitting the facilities and creating programming from an athlete's perspective."</p><br><br><em></em> </div>

	<div><p>(see also Tom&#39;s and Peter&#39;s 2010 senior profiles) While we don&#39;t want to imply that Tom and Peter are not independent people, but as Peter told Rowing News, &quot;We are better together, whatever it is, it&#39;s like 2 + 2 = 5.&quot; The brothers weren&#39;t afforded much time with the SBTC and came and left as an extremely focused double - the previous year, they finished 2nd at U.S. Olympic Trials, just missing a ticket to Beijing. They first arrived before 2009 senior trials, and trained with coach Larry Gluckman before racing in Princeton. At trials, Tom and Peter got down to business and won a very tough best-of-three race series, meaning that they were selected to race at World Championships in Poland. Just before that trip, they returned to Craftsbury to dial in their training, believing that Craftsbury had provided the magic for their success. In their time with the SBTC, Tom and Peter also won the Canadian Henley 2x, and they went on to win the Head of the Charles Championship Double. Peter said: &quot;Life seems to be getting busier all the time. Craftsbury fixed that. When we arrived in Craftsbury, Tom put the car in park and shut off the engine. It became nice and quiet in the car. I opened the door and stepped outside for the first time... it was even more quiet. This is a very important aspect of Craftsbury for me. I instantly felt a sense of focus, purpose, and direction.&quot;</p><br><br><em></em> </div>

Since then, he has rowed with crews which have won races at Henley, U.S. Nationals, Canadian Henley, Head of the Charles, and many others. Tom and his brother finished second at the 2008 Olympic trials, but made up for it the next year by earning a spot at World Championships.</p>
<p><strong>Summer/Fall 2010:</strong> After a frustrating weekend of racing at U.S. Nationals, Tom and Peter came to Craftsbury to try to get the magic back in their double. So far, it seems to have worked: they posted a huge victory in the senior double at Canadian Henley. Tom said of that effort, "We were able to get back to our rowing and it all came together. We just let all of the negatives fall away and just raced hard! This summer has been tough, but we are learning from each experience and it builds our confidence for the next step." His goal is still to make the 2010 World Championship team in New Zealand.</p><br><br><em></em> </div>

It helped me to develop technically, physically, learn about physiological development, proper dieting techniques, and developing training plans. Rowing for Craftsbury opened my eyes to international competition, and showed me how far I need to develop to compete at that level."</p>
<p><strong>2009:</strong> Hank began rowing at Worcester Polytechnic Institute, and spent a short time with the SBTC in 2009. Hank says this of his experience: "SBTC means elite rowing with people who are completely dedicated to the sport. It provides a chance to focus on nothing besides rowing. Eating, sleeping, training - all of it focused on the goal of being faster on the water come racing season. Following this summer's work at SBTC, I got to stroke the varsity boat to its best ever finish in the Head of the Charles Regatta, 4th place."</p>
<p><strong>2011:</strong> Hank stroked WPI's varsity 8+ to finishes of 4th in the Head of the Charles and 3rd at New Englands in the 2009-2010 season. He was selected to the 2010 All-ECAC team.</p><br><br><em></em> </div>
