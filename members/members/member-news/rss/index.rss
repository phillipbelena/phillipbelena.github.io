			<link>https://www.craftsbury.com/general/about-the-center/news/detail/1839/</link>
			<description>The 2019 Forestry Series is based around the theme of  &quot;Changes in the Forests and Fields Around US - a deep dive into the phenology and ever-changing world of the Black River Watershed&quot;. Over the course of the summer we will explore the flora and fauna of our region and the seasonal changes they experience.The series will take place monthly, 7:30pm on Tuesdays, except for the final talk in October which will occur on a Thursday. All talks are hosted at the Craftsbury Outdoor Center Activity Center, are free and open to the public with refreshments served. Tuesday July 23rdat 7:30pm: The insects of summer.Emily Meacham (Vermont Dept. of Forests, Parks and Recreation) – We wouldn’t have birds without insects!  People often associate summer in the woods with black flies, mosquitoes, and deer flies, but there are many more (and much more interesting) insects that can be found in our forests, fields, and waterways.  Come learn about the incredible diversity of insects around you and leave with a new appreciation for the thousands of insects that don’t leave you scratching!Tuesday August 13that 7:30pm: Fish behavior in late summer: what do fish do when the water warms up.Pete Emerson (Vermont Dept. of Fish and Wildlife) – Like animals on land, fish change their behavior over the course of the summer and fall.  This may be to find food, stay cool, or to prepare for breeding.  Come learn about what fish are doing in late summer and where to find them.Tuesday September 10that 7:30pm: Why leaves change color and what trees do to prepare for winter.  Josh Halman (Vermont Dept. of Forests, Parks and Recreation) – Each year the hillsides in Vermont light up in a cacophony of colors, but why does this happen?  Is it the colder temperatures, the changes in the length of the day, the countless thousands of tourists snapping pictures?  What do these changes have to do with how a tree prepares for the cold winter months?  Come learn the answers to these questions and more, as we dive deep into the science of fall foliage.Thursday October 10that 7:30pm: What are mammals doing to prepare for winter?Jill Kilborn (New Hampshire Fish and Game Dept.) – Snowshoe hares change their fur color in the winter, but when does this happen and why?  Come learn about interesting adaptions of the mammals of our northern forest, and what they are doing in late fall as the seasons change.    Download a poster to share with your friends</description>

			<title>Over $5000 raised via Ski &amp; Bike Swap</title>
			<link>https://www.craftsbury.com/general/about-the-center/news/detail/2135/</link>
			<description>The 2nd biennial Ski and Bike Swap raised over $5000 for the Kathy Wright Memorial Scholarship fund and redistributed more than 650 bikes, skis and gear into the hands of more than 200 skiers and their families! Donations to the Scholarship fund were based on consigned gear sales (25% of each item price). The Scholarship itself supports Craftsbury juniors in their skiing ventures, whether by making introductory programs more affordable or helping junior racers travel to camps and races. Recipients have thus far taken part in a variety of opportunities, from the New England BKL Festival up through Scandinavian Cup races. Last winter, the scholarship committee awarded 71 total scholarships, amounting to $20,420 in awards for program fee waivers and travel support. That’s 45 unique kids that received financial aid of some kind throughout the year, accounting for over 27% of the ski club’s youth winter program participants in &#039;17-18.But the swap is about more than just fundraising. &quot;We are psyched to have raised a bunch (more than $5,200!) for the scholarship fund, obviously, but we’re equally excited about how many people walked away from the swap with new-to-them gear, ready for many more seasons of fun,” junior ski coach Audrey Mangan explained. Items ranged from mountain bikes to ski boots, skis and clothing.  The swap brought the Activity Center to mid-winter, race-weekend life, bustling with a flood of people browsing the event. “The bike shop and Activity Center had lines out the door before we opened at 10:00am, and it was hard to keep up with the checkout line for the first 90 minutes,” admitted Mangan. Ski shop employee, swap attendee, and BKL parent Kara Dunn described the scene: “It was crazy! Think Nordic Black Friday!”The ski swap embodies much of the New England ethos of thrift and reuse, as well as the non-profit Craftsbury Center&#039;s mission: sustainable reuse of materials extending their life - while supporting active, healthy lifestyles affordably. Massive thanks to all the wonderful volunteers who are the backbone of this event. Like so many of our events, it couldn&#039;t happen without their generous donations of time and energy. It was especially wonderful to see so many community members come out to gear up for winter! Hope to see you out on the trails soon, perhaps sporting a new purchase!</description>

			<title>CCDP wins final &#039;18 VTYCL race</title>
			<link>https://www.craftsbury.com/general/about-the-center/news/detail/2126/</link>
			<description>The Craftsbury Cycling Development Program (CCDP) wrapped up their Vermont Youth Cycling League (VTYCL) season last Sunday. They raced under sunny skies on their home course at the Outdoor Center. This crew had a strong performance, with seasoned veterans and MTB racing newbies all joining together to top the team ranking!  Beginning with the varsity boys, Finn Sweet led the way, winning his 2nd race of the season. Jack Young was 4th, followed closely by Makail Tipton in 5th. Jack and Makail received a shout out from coach Ollie Burruss, as they “went back and forth all season and really made jumps as riders and racers.” In the JV boys’ race, Greyson Davis unfortunately suffered a flat tire and was unable to finish. In the 9th-10th grade girls’ race, Maya Remick, in her first VTYCL race, took the win. In the 9th-10th grade boys’ race, David Moody, also new the VTYCL scene, was 9th. In the 7th-8th grade girls’ race, Amelia Circosta continued her winning ways and topped the podium for her third consecutive VTYCL race. In the 7th-8th grade boys’ race, Orion Cenkl was 2nd, followed by Leo Circosta in 4th. Trevyor Densmore finished 7th, moving up from 12th in last week’s race. Ollie said that the “biggest improvement on the day was Trevyor finishing 7th. That was rad.” In the 5th-6th grade boys’ race, the CCPD was represented by two newcomers, Charlie Kehler in 7th and Max Demaine in 14th. Max got a migraine, which slowed this speed demon down a bit. The CCD Program showed its depth and skill by topping the team results over the three-race series. They bested by Mansfield Mountain Riders by 69 points and CVU by 299 points. They did this by winning the team standing at each of the three races. This illustrates the power of a strong team!Congratulations to these speedsters for endeavoring in to, and making a mark on, a new racing scene! “[I&#039;m] looking forward to seeing how all the kids do after their first year racing bikes,” said Ollie - think we all are! See results from the race here and some pictures over here. Find a whole gallery over here.</description>

			<title>App Gap Challenge</title>
			<link>https://www.craftsbury.com/general/about-the-center/news/detail/2083/</link>
			<description>Last Saturday, dozens of racers hit the pavement near Waitsfield, VT to power up the App Gap in the annual App Gap Challenge. The race was skiathlon style, with a ski exchange from classic to skate in the middle. Women raced 5k while men raced 7.25k. We had a strong and fast Craftsbury contingent, with GRP’ers and junior skiers putting themselves to the test. In the men’s race, Adam Martin was 2nd overall, followed by Finn Sweet in 7th (3rd junion). Trey Jones was 9th, Griffin Wright was 13th, and Orion Cenkl was 60th. On the women’s side, Caitlin Patterson took the win and set a new course record. She was followed closely by Ida Sargent. The junior women’s podium was made up of Craftsbury affiliated girls, with Rena Schwartz as the 1st junior woman (7th overall), Alex Lawson as 2nd (9th overall), and Callie Young the 3rd (10th overall). Quincy Massey-Bierman was 12th overall, Phoebe Sweet was 14th, and Sydney Kulis was 46th. Congrats to everyone for putting their midsummer (roller) ski speed to the test on the Eastern slopes of the Green Mountains!

			<title>Juniors on the Podium at Second Eastern Cup </title>
			<link>https://www.craftsbury.com/general/about-the-center/news/detail/1949/</link>
			<description>Amid what NENSA deemed “one of the most dramatic winter events in recent history,” racers from all over the east descended upon the Ripton, Vermont trail network. Thanks to the tireless efforts of the Rikert Nordic Center staff and volunteers, the second Eastern Cup of the season went off without a hitch. After Friday’s high 40’s and ample rainfall, Saturday brought cooler temperatures and sleet turning to snow, and then Sunday brought plunging mercury and howling wind making for tough conditions for athletes, coaches, volunteers, parents, race officials, and anyone else involved.Saturday was a classic sprint day for all, where race organizers and Rikert staff creatively drew together a solid course despite snow loss. On the men’s side, Finn Sweet qualified for the open heats in 25th, where he got eliminated in the quarterfinals and ended the day in 26th. He was the 3rd U16. Jack Young was 70th overall in the qualifier, but the 12th U16 (after those who made the open heats), so he earned a spot in the U16 heats, where he ultimately finished 5th in the A final. The rest of the Craftsbury boys finished within 20 seconds of each other. Trey Jones was 86th (17th U16), Greyson Davis was 88th (18th U16), Bjorn Westervelt was 92nd (46th U18), Daymien Ide was 101st (24th U16),  Makail Tipton was 111th (30th U16), and Aiden Casey was 113th (32th U16). For the women, Callie Young continued her Eastern Cup sprint domination. She ended the day on the top step of the women’s podium, while teammate Phoebe Sweet wasn’t far behind in 3rd (and 3rd U18). Marika Massey- Bierman qualified in 13th. After finishing 4th in her quarterfinal, she ended up 16th overall (2nd U20). Adrienne Remick skied in the open heats for the first time ever this weekend. She qualified in 16th and finished the day in 18th. She was the 3rd U16. Jordi Kulis was 49th (5th U20), while younger sister Sydney was 88th (35th U16).Sunday’s frigid temperatures brought a 5k freestyle race for the U16’s and a 10k freestyle race for everyone else. In the U16 boy’s division, Finn led the way in 3rd. Trey was 8th and Jack was hot on his heels in 9th. Mikail was 23rd, Aiden was 27th, Grayson was 29th, and Daymien was 33rd. In the U16 girls race, Quincy Massey- Bierman was 2nd while Adrienne tied with a Mansfield Nordic Club athlete for 6th. Aliza Wright was 39th and Sydney Kulis was close behind in 40th.In the open men’s race, Griffin Wright was 20th (10th U18) and Bjorn was 41st (22nd U18). GRP’er Adam Martin jumped in and was 2nd. In the women’s race, Callie was 7th (3rd U18) and Marika was 15th (3rd U20). Jordi was 39th (7th U20) and Claire Ellis was 61st (43rd U18).Congratulations to all these juniors for continuing to ski fast despite trying weather conditions! Eastern Cup racing continues February 3rd and 4th at the Trapp Family Lodge.See full results here. </description>

			<title>Emily Dreissigacker Named to Olympic Team </title>
			<link>https://www.craftsbury.com/general/about-the-center/news/detail/1948/</link>
			<description>Last week, Emily Dreissigacker was named to the US Olympic Team for Biathlon. She is set to compete in Pyeongchang, South Korea in mid February. Emily is a member of the US National B team and trains both in Craftsbury and with the National Team in Lake Placid.Emily had solid results throughout the rollerski trial season, with a standout victory in a sprint race in October. She was then selected to travel with the National Team to Canmore, Alberta for an early season training camp. From here, she was chosen to go to Europe for the pre-Christmas World Cups in Ostersund, Sweden and Annecy Le Grand Bornand, France. Not having the results needed for Olympic qualification, she was sent down the IBU Cup level after the New Year. Here, she was on fire in what was deemed the final “Olympic Trials,” consisting of three IBU Cup races and one team time trial. She was either the first or second American woman in each of these competitions. In the final IBU cup race, an individual in Arber, Germany, she cleaned the race (hit 20 out of 20 targets) and finished fifth, one of the best American finishes at this level. Based on these performances, Emily punched her ticket, to represent the US in Pyeonchang. Emily will join GRP biathlon teammates Susan Dunklee and Clare Egan at the Olympics. Read the US Biathlon Association’s press release about Emily’s Olympic nomination here.</description>

			<title>CNSC Juniors at US Nationals </title>
			<link>https://www.craftsbury.com/general/about-the-center/news/detail/1944/</link>
			<description>Last week, three Craftsbury juniors and one Craftsbury alum turned Middlebury skier made the trip to Anchorage, Alaska for U.S. Nationals. This is a large and competitive race series, where qualifications for many events are on the line. For the older racers, the Olympics or National Champion titles could be the prize, but for the younger competitors the goal is to gain experience and qualify for a chance to race in Europe on the U18 Scandinavian Cup trip later this winter. Phoebe Sweet, Callie Young, and Griffin Wright were the current juniors that travelled, as well as current Middlebury skier Alex Lawson, under the tutelage of Anna Schulz, Jake Barton, and Ollie Burruss (who were also helping with ski service for the GRP).The first race was on January 3rd and was a freestyle 10k for women and 15k for men. The juniors got the opportunity to go head-to-head with the senior racers. In the women’s race, Callie was 49th overall (5th U18), Alex was 53rd (10th U20), and Phoebe was 82nd (15th U18). In the men’s race, Griffin was 112th (24th U18). On January 5th the freestyle sprint races took place. In the men’s qualifying round Griffin was 137th (31st U18). For the women, Callie was 33rd, only one second out of qualifying for the open heats, and was the 2nd U18. Alex was 46th (5th U20) and Phoebe was 82nd (21st U18). Callie and Alex both moved on to the junior heats. Callie was 1st in her quarterfinal, 2nd in her semi-final, and then 2nd in the junior A-final. This landed her as the 2nd U18 on the day. Alex was 2nd in her quarterfinal then 5th in her semi final. After one day off, the juniors got ready for their last race of the series: the classic mass start. Griffin raced a 10k classic mass start, where he finished 41st and was the 17th U18. The women raced a fast and furious 5k mass start. Alex was the first Craftsbury racer across the line in 11th (8th U20), followed by Callie in 19th (6th U18), and Phoebe in 33rd (16th U18). Based on this week of racing, Callie was named to the U18 Scandinavian Cup trip team. She and 11 other U18 men and women will travel to Vuokatti, Finland from January 21 to January 31 for three races. Stay tuned for more on that later in the month.   Congratulations to this crew for a week of great racing in a tough field! Junior racing continues this weekend at the Rikert Nordic Center for the second Eastern Cup of the season. See full results here. </description>

			<title>Ski for Light Winter Trip</title>
			<link>https://www.craftsbury.com/general/about-the-center/news/detail/1930/</link>
			<description>From January 5th through 8th, the Center will be hosting the New England Regional Ski for Light Winter trip. Ski for Light is a nonprofit organization that promotes the physical fitness of visually-impaired and mobility-impaired adults, through hiking, canoeing, and tandem bicycling in the summer, and cross-country skiing and snowshoeing in the winter.  Ski for Light has made several trips to the Outdoor Center in previous years and they have been very popular!Want to get involved?  Ski for Light is looking for up to five people who are interested in being guides for the weekend. You need to be an intermediate or advanced classic cross-country skier who is interested in being paired with a visually or mobility-impaired person. You will serve as a volunteer instructor/ guide. You do not need any prior guiding experience, as you will receive the necessary training from the trip organizers.A few more details on guiding: throughout the trip, two sets of classic tracks are laid so guide and athlete can ski side by side.  The role of the guide varies for visually-impaired and mobility impaired athletes. With visually-impaired skiers, the guide makes the skier aware of upcoming terrain changes, offers instructional tips and suggestions, and tells the skier about the countryside. For mobility-impaired participants, the guide provides instructional tips and physical assistance as necessary. The emphasis of the Ski for Light trip is on recreational skiing, rather than competition, with the skier and guide deciding together on the length and difficulty of their ski. Interested?

			<title>CNSC Juniors off to a Strong Start at the Opener </title>
			<link>https://www.craftsbury.com/general/about-the-center/news/detail/1922/</link>
			<description>The CNSC juniors got their racing legs under them for the first time this season at the Craftsbury Opener. As we often do at early season racers, competitors skied multiple loops on manmade snow, made possible only because of the tireless efforts of the grooming crew. Women and U16 and under men did five loops for 5.5k and U18 and older men did seven loops for 7.7k.In the men’s 5.5k race, Craftsbury had a very strong presence at the front of the field. Trey Jones was 2nd, Bjorn Westervelt was 3rd, Jack Young was 4th, and Greyson Davis was 5th. Next, Mikail Tipton was 6th, Charlie Krebs was 12th, and Daymien Ide was 13th. In the 7.7k race, Griffin Wright was 9th and Henry Hoffert was 26th, amongst a strong collegian dominated field.In the women’s race, Callie Young led the way for the CNSC juniors (and all juniors) in 2nd, followed by Phoebe Sweet in 8th. The sister duo of Marika and Quincy Massey- Bierman went 16th and 17th, respectively. Next was Adrienne Remick in 19th, Jordi Kulis in 22nd, Clare Ellis in 37th, and Sydney Kulis in 40th.Congrats to all these juniors for getting those first race nerves out of the way and throwing down some awesome races. The Eastern Cup season kicks off on December 16th in Fort Kent, Maine.See results from today’s race here. And a huge thank you to the grooming crew, junior coaches, and volunteers who make this all possible!</description>

			<title>Update: Ski Swap</title>

			<description>Inquiring minds want to know- when is this year&#039;s ski swap going to be?! Alas, not this year! We will likely host one next year. We are thinking a two year rotation will allow us to accumulate enough items to make the sale robust and worthwhile each time it&#039;s held. So, stay tuned for more details next fall! </description>

			<title>Vermonster CrossFit Competition </title>
			<link>https://www.craftsbury.com/general/about-the-center/news/detail/1900/</link>
			<description>A new sort of event for Craftsbury! Last Sunday, Green Mountain CrossFit hosted a competition called the Vermontster Team Challenge. Two Craftsbury teams battled it out in a series of CrossFit workouts held in Berlin, Vermont. Each team was made up of four people. They all regularly attend CrossFit at the Center. “Team Crossbury” included Margaret Pitkin, Gabe Tempesta, Eloise Girard, and Pablo Coddou. “The Sore Thumbs” was comprised of Jake Barton, Eric Schulz, Paige Weirenko, and Cori Sanders. They both competed in the 14 team Recreational Division, which is for beginner and intermediate (CrossFit) athletes who are proficient at fundamental CrossFit skills but may not have mastered difficult movements. The competition consisted of four events. The events were a wide variety of workouts and ran the gamut for what they were comprised of. Some noteworthy components included a one minute jump rope event, 300 meter sprint, and truck pull (which is reported to be a very technical undertaking!). Highlights included The Sore Thumbs victory in the jump rope event and Crossbury’s 4th place finish in the 300-meter sprint. At the end of the day, Team Crossbury finished 8th and The Sore Thumbs finished 9th. Crossbury member Margaret Pitkin said “many thanks to Judy Geer and the COC not only for hosting weekly classes, but also for out team uniforms (COC fluorescent yellow tanks), and the fantastic C2 equipment we get to train on.” </description>
