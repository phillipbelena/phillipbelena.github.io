After graduating from Brown, Heidi spent two years coaching the women's cross country and distance track team at Tufts University before earning her Masters Degree in Counseling at the University of Vermont. Heidi has an Endurance Events Specialist Certification from the USTFCCCA Track &amp; Field Academy and a USATF Level 1 Track &amp; Field Coaching Certifcation.

<p><em>Craftsbury running camps have it all - knowledgeable coaches, delicious locally-sourced meals, and the rolling hills, dirt roads, and soft trails of Vermont’s Northeast Kingdom. I left each camp last summer refreshed and inspired by both the athletes and coaches. The Craftsbury running community extends beyond a week or two in the summer – you’ll bring your Craftsbury ties with you when you leave!</em> </p>

<p><span>Jack Pilla, from Charlotte, VT will be coaching at Craftsbury for his fourth season. Jack was late coming into his running career but was always an endurance athlete. After his first marathon in 2001, he continued going farther and longer and started to compete in the ultra events in 2004 and has never looked back. Jack can be found running a local fast 5k or traveling to Europe to run a 200+ mile race in the Alps but is happiest when running along mountain summits and on the trails. Jack has been a personal running coach since 2009 and was also the assistant XC coach for the girls at South Burlington High School. He is a member of the Green Mountain Athletic Association, Brand Ambassador for Hoka One One and is the Pace Team Coordinator for Vermont City Marathon. Jack has completed over 80 ultra races and is looking forward to running TDS in August. TDS starts in Courmayer, Italy and runs 90 miles with 30,000 feet of elevation gain to end in</span> Chamonix, France. </p>
<p><em>Craftsbury is a wonderful place to run with fabulous trails and quaint Vermont back roads. I&#039;m looking forward to coaching there again and sharing my experiences and knowledge with many athletes. </em> </p>

<p>Andrew grew up in the White Mountains but it wasn’t until crewing Scott Jurek in his Appalachian Trail FKT that he tapped into his full potential as a trail runner. Since then, Andrew has run all the bucket list superhikes in the Whites and continues to create new ones each summer. As part of his adventures he documents them in the process with photographs and videos. Andrew's adventure highlights include: FKT Holder for the White Mountain Direttissima, 4x Tuckerman Inferno “Tuckerman”, 3rd Fastest Time on the White Mountain Hut Traverse, 100 Mile Finisher, and International Race experience (UTMB OCC).</p>
<p><em>It&#039;s a challenge to leave the &quot;White Mountain Vortex&quot; but any chance you get to experience new trails is worth the effort. Vermont has so much to offer and has some of the most beautiful terrain period. </em> </p>

<p><em>I am happy to be back in Vermont and returning to my roots as a runner. I&#039;m thrilled to be able to do this in beautiful Craftsbury, and to be able to focus on helping runners of all abilities develop strong technique, implement well-rounded and ambitious training plans, and push themselves mentally and physically.<br />

<p>Having played baseball and basketball throughout my childhood, running did not become part of my life until I was 17 when I joined the cross-country team. After one season, I was hooked and running has since been a big part of my life.  During college, I ran cross country and track setting pr's in the 1500 (4.02) and 5000 (14:53). As a post collegiate runner my focus has been on the marathon and after placing 75th overall at the 2011 Boston Marathon (2:28:50) people starting asking me if I would help them train for their upcoming fall marathon. Again, I was hooked.  Helping others reach their maximum potential is not only rewarding, but also further deepens my love of the sport. This passion has fueled me to continue my own training. At age 36, I ran my personal best at the 2015 Philadelphia Marathon placing 9th overall (2:27:35).  Other PR’s are 1:07.48 for the half marathon, 31:22 for 10K and 14:41 for 5K.</p>
<p><em>Coaching adult runners is a fun and challenging endeavor that requires the ability to not only create tailored training plans but to match those to each individual’s work and family schedule. I look forward to hearing to your story</em> </p>
