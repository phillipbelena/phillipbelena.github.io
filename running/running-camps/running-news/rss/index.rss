			<link>https://www.craftsbury.com/general/about-the-center/news/detail/2113/</link>
			<description>January 2-5, 2020 - 4 DaysWe&#039;re excited to announce our winter cross-training weekend for runners. Treadmills have their place. Gym work has its time. But winter can get claustrophobic indoors. Add some skis, snowshoes or winter run gear? You&#039;ll move thru the winter landscape noiselessly, another animal exploring under its own power. During your four days at Craftsbury, you&#039;ll unlock tactics to embrace winter across a variety of disciplines: daily runs, ski clinics, snowshoeing on our more than 100k of groomed trails, plus another 20k of singletrack trails throughout our extensive trail network - all right out the door. Once you&#039;ve learned to winter, you&#039;ll reclaim your freedom to enjoy trails and woods that you haven&#039;t visited since last summer.More details to come, but get this weekend of fun, challenging cross-training and developing new skills on your calendar!</description>

			<title>Craftsbury Beer Run 2019 Results </title>
			<link>https://www.craftsbury.com/general/about-the-center/news/detail/2281/</link>
			<description>60 intrepid runners set out this morning under cloudy skies and cool temps to tackle the 2019 Craftsbury Beer Run. A point to point half marathon from the Outdoor Center to Hill Farmstead Brewery, the course covered trail, dirt road, and class IV roads, with some impressively grueling climbs and challenging terrain. What a way to spend the first morning of June here in the NEK!Frederick Rountree of Barre, VT ran to the overall win - and King of the Hill glory - in a time of 1:30:51. Fellow Vermonters Paul Chambers of Newport and Jake Lester of Craftsbury rounded out the top three in times of 1:38:14 and 1:40:32, respectively. Hallie Grossman of Craftsbury Common, VT captured the Queen of the Hill crown and fourth overall in a time of 1:44:03. Lori Preston of Richmond, VT ran to second place female in 1:56:19 and Courtney Koshchei crossed the line as third female in 1:57:31. Congrats to all the runners for conquering the climbs and trails of this year&#039;s challenging course! Full results can be found here. With the help of our local partners and community support, we were able to raise over $2,000 for the WonderArts VT &#039;Farm to Kids&#039; Table&#039; program. WonderArts VT has served both youth and adult populations in the Greater Hardwick Area (Craftsbury, Greensboro, Hardwick) for the last two years. Their goal is to support lifelong learning for all age groups by emphasizing creativity, recreation, technology, and sustainability. The Farm to Kids&#039; Table program works with age groups 6-12 and 13-16 and teaches basic cooking skills under the direction of a WonderArts staff chef. We are excited to be able to support this kid-centered and kid-driven initiative working to empower young people through learning about local food and food creation.Many, many thanks to Hill Farmstead Brewery for the beer and ideal race destination, Craftsbury General Store for the tasty picnic, KIS Kombucha for sharing more local brews, UnTapped for the maple feeds, Gebbies&#039; Maplehurst Farm for the liquid gold prizes, and John Lazenby for capturing the scene! Thank you also to the volunteers and community for your generous support - this event could not have happened without you!And, of course, thank you to all the participants for embarking on the 2019 Craftsbury Beer Run! We are excited to have partnered with so many local businesses in a team effort to raise money for WonderArts VT&#039;s &#039;Farm to Kid&#039;s Table&#039; program. A day filled with running and local food &amp;amp; drink really did feel like the perfect way to give back to such a great program. We hope to have you back for another adventure run through the Northeast Kingdom soon!For more photos (coming soon!) and information about our fundraiser run for WonderArts VT, please visit our Facebook page and website event page. </description>

Relay legs ranged between three and six miles. The GRPers finished an impressive 4th place in the open mixed 3-5 person category, in a time of 2:54. Craftsbury junior Cormac Leahy teamed up with four other junior boys to form the GMAA (Green Mountain Athletic Association) Juniors team, which finished 3rd overall in the 3-5 person category and 1st in the junior boys category.

			<title>Looke, Schwartz gift Center Gatorade POTY Grants</title>
			<link>https://www.craftsbury.com/general/about-the-center/news/detail/2149/</link>
			<description>In light of Thanksgiving, it seemed especially pertinent to recognize two athletes who contributed to the Center this past year. Of course, we&#039;re thankful for all the members of our community, but we&#039;re particularly grateful for the generosity of two athletes from the Montpelier area who thoughtfully named the Center as the recipient of their Gatorade player of the year awards. Stephen Looke and Rena Schwartz were named the &#039;17-18 recipients of the prize for Vermont XC Runners. Along with the personal accolade comes a $1000 donation in their name to a non-profit of their choice, and Craftsbury was the fortunate recipient of their largesse. Stephen Looke ran for U-32, capping a successful High School career by taking the individual 2017 State Championship in 16:51.9 and leading U-32 to the team title. He skied for U-32 as well, being part of last year&#039;s 2nd place boy&#039;s team, before jumping on the track to take an individual state title in the 800m as well as helping U-32 to the team win. In addition to his athletic excellence, he graduated with a 3.5 GPA and was student council president. He now attends and runs for UVM. Green Mountain Valley School skier (and long-time Craftsbury ski community member) Rena Schwartz gifted the Craftsbury Outdoor Center her Gatorade Player of the Year award grant. 2017 marked Rena&#039;s third year of winning the Gatorade honors - honors she could&#039;ve just as easily won for cross-country skiing or her accomplishments on the track as well. She is skiing for Dartmouth This story gets better though: athletes selected by Gatorade can submit an essay about the organization they selected for their $1000 grant, and why they selected it. Gatorade selects 12 of these essays (one for each sport they recognize) as their spotlight grant winner. These second grants are worth an additional $10000 to the athlete&#039;s selected organization. Rena&#039;s essay won that grant for Craftsbury as well! &quot;Not only does Rena have exceptional academic record and competitive athletic results, but she is a pleasure to spend time with,&quot; writes her GMVS coach, Colin Rodgers. &quot;She is kind, honest, dependable, and incredibly hard-working. If you ever ask anything of Rena you can expect it to be done with focus and attention to detail.&quot;Congrats to both athletes and best of luck in your ongoing athletic endeavors, and thank you so much for thinking of Craftsbury!</description>

			<title>2018 Black River Beatdown Results</title>
			<link>https://www.craftsbury.com/general/about-the-center/news/detail/2134/</link>
			<description>We had an awesome time hosting the 2018 Ironwood Adventureworks Black River Beatdown this Sunday, October 28. Almost 50 runners braved the rain and cold temperatures for 15k, 30k, and 45k trail races. Many of our competitors were in costume, and all enjoyed one of the last opportunities for a trail race in 2018. Big thanks to Ironwood Adventureworks for organizing the race, and to all of our runners for coming out!The 15k one loop race was the largest field of the day, with 25 competitors. Claire McIlvennie of Winooski, VT won the overall 15k as well as the women&#039;s race in a blazing time of 1:17:12. Second place in the women&#039;s race went to Elizabeth Anderson, and third place went to Ruth Addante. Elizabeth and Ruth also placed 3rd and 4th overall. The first men&#039;s 15k finisher was Robert Primeau, second place went to Paul Charron, and third place was Kyle Darling.A smaller group of runners braved the two lap, 30k course. The overall victory and men&#039;s win went to GRP skier Akeo Maifield-Carucci with a time of 2:39:51. Second place went to Jonathan Brown, and third place to Jake Wallenius-Duda. First place in the women&#039;s race went to Haley Heinrich, second place went to Caitlin Patterson, and third place to Stephanie Parent.Only five racers completed the three lap, 45k race. Our winner, Eric Morse, finished the course in a time of 4:33:10. Second place was Robert Cary of Albany, VT, and third place went to Robert Griffiths of Craftsbury, VT. A few of our resident GRP athletes joined in on the fun on Sunday and had great things to say about the event. From Ben Lustgarten, who competed in the 30k, &quot;the course marking was great, course was fun and varied, aid stations were awesome!&quot;. Caitlin Patterson, 2nd place female in the 30k, loved the &quot;great costumes and enthusiasm, a fun scene with everyone making the most of the cool fall weather.&quot;Full results from the 2018 Black River Beatdown available HERE.Additionally, click HERE to access a full photo album thanks to Wes Vear.</description>

			<title>Caldwell and Martin Podium at Newburyport Half Marathon </title>
			<link>https://www.craftsbury.com/general/about-the-center/news/detail/2131/</link>
			<description>Last weekend, Running Director Heidi Caldwell and GRP skier Adam Martin travelled to Newburyport, Massachusetts for the Newburyport Half Marathon. This race, held on Massachusetts’s North Shore, is relatively flat and fast and annually draws a very competitive field. Undeterred by the competition, Heidi and Adam both delivered noteworthy performances. Adam finished 2nd, in a blistering time of 1:06:18 (roughly a 5:05 minute mile) only two seconds behind 1st place Tadesse Yae Dabi. The Newburyport Daily News reported that Dabi is an “Ethiopian distance star” that has “competed all over the world.” Heidi was 6th overall and won the women’s race by a convincing seven minutes, in a time of 1:13:43 (about a 5:35 mile time). This time is nearly two minutes faster than her half marathon performance from earlier this month! Adam’s focus will now shift back to skiing, while Heidi’s next race is the California International Marathon in Sacramento on December 2nd. Congratulations to these two for highlighting Craftsbury’s running prowess. Full results from the race can be found here and stay tuned for an update on Heidi’s December marathon. </description>

			<title>Heidi Caldwell wins and sets new course record at Rockfest Half Marathon</title>
			<link>https://www.craftsbury.com/general/about-the-center/news/detail/2117/</link>
			<description>Running camp director Heidi Caldwell certainly left an indelible mark on Sunday&#039;s Smuttynose Rockfest Half Marathon in Hampton Beach, New Hampshire. Impressive feat number one was setting a new women’s course record in 1:15:15. And if that wasn&#039;t quite enough, impressive feat number two was winning the race overall! In fact, the top two finishers were women. Running camp coach Sam Davis also raced, finishing in just over two hours. The Rockfest Half Marathon draws a large and competitive field to coastal New Hampshire, with more than 4,000 participants toeing the line, as well an additional 1,700 in the 5k race. In other news, another running camp coach Jack Pilla also put on his racing shoes this weekend. He did the VT50 in the Brownsville area, where he competed in the 50 mile event. He placed 19th overall and won his age group. Congrats to all on a great weekend of racing! See results from the Rockfest here and the VT50 here.</description>

We&#039;re welcoming runners of all levels and experience to connect with fellow runners in the area and gain running-specific knowledge and skills. Wellness Running/Walking GroupMondays, 6:00pm beginning June 4th - meet at the Activity Center Main Lodge. Feeling stressed or burnt out? Looking for a fresh approach to physical activity? The aim of this group is to provide a supportive environment to help you establish a positive running and/or walking mindfulness practice in your daily life. Our running and walking will be complemented by mindfulness exercises focused on centering, reducing stress, and increasing body awareness. Each session will offer both a running and walking route - runners, walkers, and run-walkers all welcome! One dedicated hour of wellness practice can help you develop skills to overcome personal challenges and set a positive tone for the rest of your week. Sessions will be led by Craftsbury Running Director Heidi Caldwell and Green Racing Project Biathlon team member Kelsey Dickinson. Give a couple of sessions a try for free, then subsequent sessions are $10/session for non-member, $5/session for all COC members like all our fitness offerings. Reminder: all Craftsbury and Albany residents are complementary members of COC, though we ask you complete this paperwork.Read more at the Wellness Walking/Running page. Community Track PracticeThursdays at 6:30pm at People&#039;s Academy Track beginning June 10th.Are you wanting to do running specific workouts, but looking for a fresh, new way to strengthen your legs to crush some k’s? Want to get into running but not sure where to start? Join the Craftsbury Outdoor Center Running Program for a community track workout at the Morrisville Track on Thursday evenings. Track workouts can be a fun and motivating way to jumpstart your running program and boost aerobic capacity.

Looking for a fresh approach to physical activity? The aim of this group is to provide a supportive environment to help you establish a positive running and/or walking mindfulness practice in your daily life. Our running and walking will be complemented by mindfulness exercises focused on centering, reducing stress, and increasing body awareness. Each session will offer both a running and walking route - runners, walkers, and run-walkers all welcome! One dedicated hour of wellness practice can help you develop skills to overcome personal challenges and set a positive tone for the rest of your week. Sessions will be led by Craftsbury Running Director Heidi Caldwell and Green Racing Project Biathlon team member Kelsey Dickinson. Give a couple of sessions a try for free, then subsequent sessions are $10/session for non-member, $5/session for all COC members like all our fitness offerings.

			<title>Caldwell posts impressive Boston time</title>
			<link>https://www.craftsbury.com/general/about-the-center/news/detail/2022/</link>
			<description>It was a historic day at the Boston Marathon this Monday, April 16, with American Desi Linden winning the women&#039;s title, the first US woman to do so in 33 years. Among the rain-soaked finishers was another female runner, this one with Craftsbury ties: newly announced running coordinator Heidi Caldwell finished an impressive 29th in the women&#039;s field, with a time of 2:54:31. She was also the first Vermont woman across the line.Caldwell trained for and raced Boston while working on her master&#039;s degree in counseling at UVM this spring. As a former Division I cross country and track runner at Brown University, she has a background in shorter races and is a multiple school record holder at Brown. Caldwell will start a new position this May as Running Coordinator at the COC, which will include organizing running camps and providing running programming to the greater Craftsbury community. Congrats to Heidi on an awesome run at Boston, and we can&#039;t wait to welcome her to Craftsbury soon!</description>

Now&#039;s also an excellent time to explore the singletrack at Hosmer Point! Check out the Hosmer Point Trail Map.The Center mission emphasizes the use and teaching of sustainable practices. Our forest management program achieves both the sustainable use of the forest while demonstrating best practices in land stewardship, to serve as an example and educational resource in the community. By participating in the Vermont State Current Use Program we are committed to maintaining the land as part of working forest.Together with our consultants, Northern Forest Conservation Services, LLC (Ross Morgan, Dawn Morgan and Rick Morrill) we have developed a long term forest management plan which supports our vision of a multi-use forest that serves several important values: - Protection of the water and soil resources- Recreational use which benefits both users and the local economy - Wildlife habitat maintenance and enhancement, from birds to bears- Production of commercial forest products such as sawtimber used for lumber and furniture as well as products like firewood, some of which helps support our our fossil-fuel free heating system goals- Educational resource to support knowledge and awareness of forest stewardshipHow and why do we “manage” a Forest?To put it simply, we humans need forests. Our society requires a diverse array of products and services generated by forest ecosystems, including water, wood, wildlife, and wild places. Trails for biking and skiing are another notable forest product! The concept of forestry and forest management developed to ensure such resources are available to both current and future generations. Using an approach that the 20th century conservationist Aldo Leopold called “intelligent tinkering”, foresters develop strategies that promote the values and products society requires while ensuring the long-term integrity of the entire forest ecosystem. Forestry is fundamentally about the future, and it is the future that guides management actions today. Forest managers use harvesting (logging) as one of many tools, to influence the development of individual parts of a forest in order to “tinker” and promote a healthy and productive forest today and in the future.“Land health is the capacity for self-renewal in the soils, waters, plants, and animals that collectively comprise the land.” - Aldo Leopold 1944Current Forest Conditions (illustration above):• Mixed-wood forest, comprised of conifer species spruce and pine, and deciduous species like maple and birch.• Dense stocking of trees with heavy competition for sunlight and resources.• Significant mortality of mature trees in spots, especially among white pine.• Limited presence of tree regeneration in form of seedlings and saplings.• Simplified canopy structure, most stems are the same age and height.The harvest in 2017 will promote the following conditions (see above illustration):• Mixed-wood forest, with healthy diversity of conifer and deciduous species.• Complex canopy structure marked by a diversity of canopy heights representing multiple ages of trees, and by different stem densities and tree diameters. • Presence of dead trees both standing and on the ground, serving as critical wildlife habitat.• A forest with significant stocking of high quality trees capable of producing valuable forest products.</description>

			<title>Baxter Winter Triathlon</title>
			<link>https://www.craftsbury.com/general/about-the-center/news/detail/1800/</link>
			<description>This past weekend, the Baxter Winter Triathlon returned to Craftsbury for the third consecutive year. The legs were switched this year from a 5k each of run, snowshoe, and ski to a 5k each of run, fat bike, and ski. Everyone seemed to really enjoy the fat biking replacement. It made everything a bit more exciting too, as some had to push their bikes for a good amount of the distance. By next year the Center is hoping to have fat tire bike rentals and demos for all to try! Keith Woodward showing us how it is done on the fat bike! (Photo from Kate Fox)There were three different race options: 5k solo race (just the run portion), 15k solo race (all three legs), and 15k team event. Chris Schaffer took home the win in the 5k solo race male division and Erin Magoon was the winner in the female division. In the 15k solo race, Lou Bregou was the male champion and Tracy Sherbook was the female champion. Team &quot;Crazy Goats&quot; claimed the team win with Ellen Finnie completing the run portion, Frank Muller on the bike, and Kate Fox racing the ski leg. Full results can be found here: http://www.baxteroutdoors.com/Results/Results_2017_Craftsbury%20Winter%20Tri.pdf&quot;Crazy Goats&quot; team members Ellen, Frank, and Kate on their respective legs. (Photos from Kate Fox)We enjoyed having everyone here for the event and are looking forward to another one in the future! </description>
